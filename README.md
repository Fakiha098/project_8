# Penguins Dataset Analysis

This project explores the Penguins dataset, which contains data on penguin species,
including features such as bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass.
The goal is to analyze the dataset to uncover patterns, visualize differences among species,
and build predictive models to classify penguin species based on their physical attributes.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Penguins dataset
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Visualization of different species and their attributes
- Predictive modeling to classify penguin species
- Model evaluation and performance metrics

 ## Installation
